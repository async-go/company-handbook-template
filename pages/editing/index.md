# Editing handbook content

## Repository structure

The content of this handbook is kept in a GitHub repository, with all of the pages that are served for the site underneath the `/pages` folder.

You can add `.md`, `.mdx`, `.js`, and `.jsx` files into any folders underneath there, and they will render as pages.
