# Handbook home

This is what your future company handbook would look like if you use this template. If you'd like to read more about how it works, check out the [README](https://github.com/async-go/company-handbook-template/blob/main/README.md) in our [GitLab project](https://github.com/async-go/company-handbook-template). The handbook is designed to be simple to use, to edit the content on this or any page you can simply edit the markdown file. Changes integrate into whatever version control you're already using, giving a nice discussion flow before merging.

## What's next

We have a lot of ideas on how to improve this handbook template to make it easier to get started. You can check out our public [issues tracker](https://github.com/async-go/company-handbook-template/issues) and see what we have planned or submit your own ideas.
