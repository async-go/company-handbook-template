# Handbook home

This is what your future company handbook would look like if you use this template; this is the starting point, and you can easily customize from here. If you'd like to read more about how it works, check out the [README](https://github.com/async-go/company-handbook-template/blob/main/README.md) in our [GitLab project](https://github.com/async-go/company-handbook-template). The handbook is designed to be simple to use, and changes integrate into whatever version control you're already using, giving you a nice discussion flow before merging.

We have a lot of ideas on how to improve this handbook template to make it easier to get started. You can check out our public [issues tracker](https://github.com/async-go/company-handbook-template/issues) and see what we have planned or submit your own ideas.
