# Company Handbook Template

This is a company handbook template meant to be used by any company that wants an easy to setup but highly customizable public or private handbook. It is implemented in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and is inspired by great ones like the ones made by [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) and [Sourcegraph](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com). It is intended to help you get some of the basic infrastructure up and running quickly, with the key difference that company handbook-specific data sources are built in. For example:

- Static content
  - Company information
  - Company-wide practices (for example, communication and async)
  - Values
  - Per-department guides
  - How to use the handbook content
- Dynamic content  
  - Team member bios (to be added)
  - Feature lists (to be added)
  - Pricing tiers (to be added)
  - Product areas (to be added)

It's designed to make all of this easy to interact with, both for technical and non-technical team members.
